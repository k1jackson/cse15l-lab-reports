## Remotely Connecting
Next, I used the [UCSD Tech Services Website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to loopup my account name for CSE 15L.

Then I opened a new terminal in VScode an used a secure shell to remotely access the ieng6 server (Note: I needed to reset my account password for this to work). To do this, I entered into the terminal:
```
$ ssh cse14lspacr@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
After prompted, I typed in my password and this was the result:
